## Simple Meteor Apollo Counter

```js
npm install

meteor
```

Wait for the app to start and find the GraphiQL UI at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

Just a simple example incrementing a counter with Apollo and Meteor.

## Contribute
It'd be cool to see several increment counts from DBs/Data Sources.
Contribute to this repo by adding more connectors.
